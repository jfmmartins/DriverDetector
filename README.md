# Driver Monitoring System (DMS) â€“ Eye State Detection

## Overview

This project is a **Driver Monitoring System (DMS)** that detects whether a driver's eyes are open or closed in real-time.
The system aims to improve **road safety** by identifying potential driver drowsiness, a major cause of accidents worldwide.
In this project the job of a DMS camera is simulated yo test if the results can be achieved by using a non dedicated camera for it, like a smartphone camera.

âœ… Real-time detection

âœ… Eye state classification (Open / Closed)

âœ… Based on Computer Vision and Deep Learning
